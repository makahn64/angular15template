BASIC ANGULAR TEMPLATE, MITCH KAHN STYLE
========================================

This template adds all the usual stuff we use for angular in all the usual places. It also adds some sample
ui-router code and an example component folder.


ABOUT THE EXAMPLES
------------------

There are examples for:
1) Basic UI-Router usage
2) Hierarchical states with a single subordinate (child) view
3) Hierachical states with multiple named views
4) Using `resolve` in a route with a mock login service to show hiding/showing content
   based on an already resolved/rejected login promise.
   
Enjoy!
