This template adds all the usual stuff we use for angular in all the usual places. It also adds some sample
ui-router code and an example component folder.

    2. cd into `assets` and run `bower update` to grab the dependencies


ABOUT THE EXAMPLES
------------------

There are examples for:
    1. Basic UI-Router usage
    2. Hierarchical states with a single subordinate (child) view
    3. Hierachical states with multiple named views
    4. Using `resolve` in a route with a mock login service to show hiding/showing content
       based on an already resolved/rejected login promise.
   
Enjoy!
